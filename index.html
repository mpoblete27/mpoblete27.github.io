    <p>Hey there! You've reached Mickey's profile. I'm an aspiring Web Developer just getting my feet wet in wide world of programming! I graduated from St. Mary's with a BS in Biology, and learning to code is a huge change of both pace and subject for me. 
    I'm a huge spider-man fan, I've got a tattoo of what his suit would look like under my skin on my calf and I've got far too much spidey memorabilia. When I'm not in front of a screen, you can find me on the trails or weight room training for my next Spartan race. Come fly with me!</p>
